Hello!  I am a Machine Learning Engineer currently working at Spotify.  I primarily build cloud-based NLP applications but I'm also interested in all types of ML, like recommendation systems, time-series data, classification/regression, etc. And all things programming/engineering! 

Contact me by email: [info@mattmckenna.io](info@mattmckenna.io)


## Current/Past Positions  (see LinkedIn for longer history)

#### Machine Learning Engineer (NLP) - Spotify (2020 - current)

I build, maintain, and improve machine learning (mostly NLP and NLU) models that power the Spotify Voice system and serve millions of users in real-time. 

#### Data Scientist - Amazon (2017 - 2020)

I worked on many ML projects as part of the ML Solutions Lab at AWS, including NLP, time-series, classification, and more. I also spent time in Alexa working on NLP/NLU models.  

#### Statistical Programmer - Harvard University (2013 - 2016)
I built statistical models to analyze clinical trail data for HIV research (see selected publications below).
